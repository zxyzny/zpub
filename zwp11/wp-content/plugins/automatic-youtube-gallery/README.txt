== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. How to get a YouTube Data API Key? =

Please follow [get Youtube API](https://plugins360.com/automatic-youtube-gallery/how-to-get-youtube-api-key/) instructions.

= 2. Help! My video gallery doesn't look right! =

First of all, don't worry! I promise you that we can get it looking right. This can be caused by a multitude of things, so try the following (in the order of appearance):

* Check your browser's javascript console to see if there are any errors that may be causing this issue.
* Make sure that your WordPress theme is not including multiple versions of jQuery and is using the latest version.
* Try disabling other plugins that are used for photo galleries, minifying scripts, widgets, or otherwise altering your site's appearance, one by one, and really determine if you need it.

If nothing works, please describe your issue and submit a ticket on our plugin support forum, you should receive a reply within 24 hours (except Sunday).

= 3. Does the plugin support third-party page builders like "Elementor", "WPBakery", "Divi", etc.? =

Yes, the plugin is fully compatible with popular page builders like Elementor, WPBakery, Divi, and more.

* For **Elementor**, the plugin provides a dedicated WordPress widget. You can find it under the "WordPress" tab in the Elementor editor. Simply drag and drop the widget into your design to embed your video gallery seamlessly.
* Alternatively, for **Elementor** and other page builders, you can use the plugin's **Shortcode Builder** to generate a shortcode. Once created, you can add the shortcode to any section or module of your favorite page builder.

This flexibility ensures you can integrate your video gallery effortlessly, regardless of your preferred page builder.

= 4. Is the plugin compatible with WordPress Multisite? =

Yes, it is. However, do not "network-activate" the plugin. Activate it only on the subsites on which you need the gallery. This can be done under "Plugins => Add New" as the Administrator user.
